Note to self: Due to my inability to keep a hold of my environment due to excessive, unrelenting attempts at learning new material - the inevitable had recently taken place. It was time to recreate my enviroment from scratch, terminal and all. Lets see if we can keep things smooth, secure, reliable, organized, and efficient this time around eh! 

P.S. Kind interesting navigating some of this new learned material with a bit more ease and peace of mind through practice and reptition. Who would've known just some silly dude could have such fun in this void.
